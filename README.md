# Career-Center-RaffleGUI

Python GUI that serves as a raffle app for Career Center events. This is my first GUI, updated versions in the works!

## Overview
Python GUI application that accepts user information into three fields: first name, last name, and student identification number. To submit an entry, the user can click "Submit" or tap the enter key. To end the raffle, click "Done" and you will be prompted for an admin user and password. I added this so that in case someone accidentaly pressed "Done" instead of "Submit" they don't close the raffle entirely :)

Also included is a shell script to run the application, and output a winner to a textfile when done.
**NOTE: ** If you'd like to run the script:
* In the if statement, change the path to where ever you plan to store these files.
  * If you don't want to include that if statement, just comment it out with '#'
* make sure to add permissions

 ```
chmod +x collect.sh
```
and to run:
```
./collect.sh
```
